###### you know, most of these are to waste time. whenever im bored, i just ask myself: "how can i avoid schoolwork today? rock paper scissors!" another good use of this is to get familiar with different language's and their syntax. below will be notes on whatever i've done, it's in order of date.

### Python - rockpaperscissors.py
---
1. really good introductory project to python. i had fun making this and adding onto it when i was first starting out, it gave me something to brag about.
2. great intro to a lot of useful functions, like basic syntax or just `time.sleep()`.
