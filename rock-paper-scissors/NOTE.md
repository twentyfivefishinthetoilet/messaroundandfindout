###### most of these were to waste time, though it did give me some great introductions to some languages.
---
### Python - rockpaperscissors.py
---
1. really good introductory project to python. i had fun making this and adding onto it when i was first starting out, it gave me something to brag about.
2. great intro to a lot of useful functions, like basic syntax or just `time.sleep()`.
---

### Ruby - rockpaperscissors.rb
---
1. i half assed it. i speedran making this just to say i did it, im sure if i took my time i could have learned the essentials like variables, built in functions, if statements, and randomization from heart if i actually studied and didn't cheat by going on Google and copying + pasting.

### C - rockpaperscissors.c
---
1. i tried to make it more or less more interesting with terminal color. it got me to learn and remember how to use macros, randomization, and string comparing and while overall being a good exercise.
2. this was also the project that got me into C and interest in other low leveled languages rather  than focusing on Python. i would gladly recommend C as a starting language... it's what im doing and im turning out (mostly) fine.
3. i think C++ would be the same exact thing just with different syntax...
