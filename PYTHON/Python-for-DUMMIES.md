<h2>Python for DUMMIES <label style="font-size: 14px;">by @twentyfivefishinthetoilet</label></h2>
<hr>
<label>this course was made to use as a cheat sheet for whenever i decide to put on my big boy pants and tutor people. in this course we'll be covering basic python functions and syntax to get you started on whatever the hell you want to do with this. before we start, let's go over some history of python.
</label>
<br>
<br>
<label>once upon a time in the 1990s, some nerd named Guido van Rossum was bored during christmas and decided to release a high leveled multi purpose programming language named Python. Rossum's main goal was to make an "easy to learn but hard to master" programming language by creating simple to read syntax while still being powerful.</label>

| PROS    | CONS |
| -------- | ------- |
| easy to use syntax makes for efficiency | memory usage is through the roof |
| easy for beginners, even @IsacVR can learn it | unsecure, prone to security breaches |
| self compiling | self compiling |
| crap ton of libraries to pick and choose from | |
| used by TONS of people today, jobs are looking for people who know Python. | |
| bragging rights | |

<small>fun fact: python is so far away from binary that it has precision issues from time to time. running "print(0.3 == (0.2 + 0.1))" will return False!</small>
<br>
<br>
<label>quick little message, i fully recommend using W3School, Geeksforgeeks, learnpython, or BroCode's videos on Youtube to learn Python. the only reason im making this is for a quick little cheat sheet and for fun. heck, maybe i'll even make a dollar off of this! ...right? <small>...right?</small></label>
<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;">it's pretty bare bones here... don't worry, this is markdown page is still a work in progress!</p>
